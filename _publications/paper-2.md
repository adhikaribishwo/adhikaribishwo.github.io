This paper proposes an annotation framework that uses an incremental learning approach on a small batch of manually labeled images, trains a detection model, uses freshly trained model to propose bounding boxes on a batch of unlabeled images, and requests the annotator do the correction on possible incorrect bounding boxes or labels proposals.
