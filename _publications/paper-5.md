The paper studies the practical implementation of a distributed computer vision system for people tracking. A particular focus is on improved data privacy when compared to the traditional surveillance approaches. This is achieved by extracting a feature vector from each detected person by a neural network in real-time in the edge device and transmitting only the feature vector to the cloud, eliminating privacy-sensitive image data transmission and storage.
