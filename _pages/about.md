I am a doctoral researcher at [Tampere University](https://www.tuni.fi/en), Finland. Where, I am working on efficient object annotation methods for image datasets(bounding boxes) and object detection on low-resourced computing devices *i.e.,* embedded devices such as Raspberry Pi.
I am working at [Silo AI](https://www.silo.ai), the largest private AI lab in the Nordics, as AI scientist.
