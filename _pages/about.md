I have completed Doctor of Science from [Tampere University](https://www.tuni.fi/en), Finland in June 2022. Where, I worked on efficient object annotation for image datasets (bounding boxes) and implementation of object detection networks on low-resourced computing devices *i.e.,* embedded devices such as Raspberry Pi.

Currently, I am working at [Silo AI](https://www.silo.ai), the largest private AI lab in the Nordics, as AI scientist.
