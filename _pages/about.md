I am a doctoral researcher at [Tampere University](https://www.tuni.fi/en), Finland. Where, I am working on efficient object annotation methods on image datasets(bounding boxes) and low resource implementation of object detection on embedded devices.
Recently, I joined [Silo AI](https://www.silo.ai), the largest private AI lab in the Nordics, as AI scientist. Where, I am working on making AI as a product for clients.
